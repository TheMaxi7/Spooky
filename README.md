My entry for Ludum Dare 55, developed in less than 72h.
Game Jam theme: Summoning

## Game Info
In the game, you find yourself on an island where you must collect souls from enemies in order to summon an ally to help you defeat Spooky.
The goal is to beat as fast as possible Spooky. Keep in mind you may be able to beat him without help, but it will take time so better figure out a way to summon some help :)

## Controls
- Move with WASD and mouse;
- Shift for sprinting and Space jumping;
- Shoot with the mouse both left and right button;
- E allows you to summon explosions;
- I to interact.

The game is full of bugs and has been made for learning purposes as well as to have fun :)
